Recently I was working on a JavaScript package that is a blockchain transaction builder, and wanted to create a set of
helpers that could be reused for any structure of a transaction. E.g. Bitcion blockchain has one transaction structure,
Equibit blockchain which is a fork of Bitcoin has slight structure modifications.

? To send a transaction into a blockchain we need to convert our data into a HEX string.

There are two tasks - building a transaction and decoding one. For building we receive a configuration JSON that we
need to create a buffer of data and covert to a HEX string. The decoding task is the opposite - having a HEX string
convert it to a buffer of bytes and interprete its sections into a key-value pairs (JSON).
